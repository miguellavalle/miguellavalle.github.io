    "I recently was given a Python coding challenge during a job interview. I was criticized for not writing \"pythonic\" enough code. The good news is that I did great with the other interviewers in the panel, so I still got the job \\o/. Afterwards, though, I decided to use the criticism as a learning opportunity, revisit the challenge and write this blog post with the resulting code, while making my best effort to be \"pythonic\". To that end, here's a basic definition: pythonic code uses the powerful idioms of Python that distinguishes it from other languages to produce elegant and concise programs. To guide me on the road to being \"pythonic\", I am using the following references:\n",

    "- Since in this exercise we are going to use generators and coroutines, my other reference is [Making sense of generators, coroutines, and “yield from” in Python](https://lerner.co.il/2020/05/08/making-sense-of-generators-coroutines-and-yield-from-in-python/) by [Reuven Lerner](https://lerner.co.il/), who teaches Python all over the world.\n",

    "In the code that follows I will cover the following topics\n",
    "\n",
    "- One of the aspects that strongly distinguishes Python from other programming languages is its approach to iterations. As Raymond Hettinger argues in his presentation, Python's `for` statement should have been called `for each` to better reflect its semantics. I will talk about iterables, iterators, the iterator protocol, generators and co-routines.\n",
