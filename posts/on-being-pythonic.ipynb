    "I recently was given a Python coding challenge during a job interview. I was criticized for not writing \"pythonic\" enough code. The good news is that I did great with the other interviewers in the panel, so I still got the job \\o/. Afterwards, though, I decided to use the criticism as a learning opportunity, revisit the challenge and write this blog post with the resulting code, while making my best effort to be \"pythonic\". To that end, here's a basic definition: pythonic code uses the powerful idioms of Python that distinguishes it from other languages to produce elegant and concise programs. To guide me on the road to being \"pythonic\", I am using the following references:\n",

    "- Since in this exercise we are going to use generators and coroutines, my other reference is [Making sense of generators, coroutines, and “yield from” in Python](https://lerner.co.il/2020/05/08/making-sense-of-generators-coroutines-and-yield-from-in-python/) by [Reuven Lerner](https://lerner.co.il/), who teaches Python all over the world.\n",

    "- One of the aspects that strongly distinguishes Python from other programming languages is its approach to iterations.

    "\n",
    "By definition, a decorator is a function that takes another function as argument and extends the behavior of the latter function without explicitly modifying it. This makes decorators a great mechanism to factor-out logic that is repeated across several functions or methods. Frequently, this is \"administrative\" logic that is not part of the main functionality that we are implementing. In our case, we are implementing two decorators that are used by the `Computer` class defined below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- As mentioned above, many `Computer` instructions can take register or literal operands. In the `Computer` class we have, for each instruction, a method that implements it. The methods for instructions that can take both types of operands are decorated with `get_argument`. This decorator retrieves the actual value to be operated on from the register specified in the instruction, when that is the case. This way, the methods can assume they only receive literal operands.\n",
    "- For debugging purposes, we may choose to log to the console the name of methods that implement instructions as they are executed, along with the arguments received. To accomplish this, we use the `log` decorator together with a `LOG` flag that is configured with `True` or `False` in the `Computer` class."

    "We can now implement the `Computer` class. Its core is the `execute()` method, which iterates over the instructions of each program by interacting with the `Program`'s `__iter__()` coroutine in the same manner we interacted with it manually above. For each `parsed_instruction` yielded by the coroutine, `execute()` passes `parsed_instruction.action` as input to Python's `getattr()` to select and execute the specific method that implements the instruction, which receives `parsed_instruction.argument` as input. Most of the methods that implement instructions return `None` to `execute()`, which in turn sends it back to the coroutine. The exceptions are the branch instructions, of which we only have `bgt`. These branch methods return the integer representing the location of the next instruction to be executed.\n",
