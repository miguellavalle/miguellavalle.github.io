About
=====

I am a Principal Software Engineer with Red Hat. I specialize in virtual
networking for IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) clouds. I have been
contributing code to the `Networking project of
OpenStack <https://opendev.org/openstack/neutron>`_ since 2013. I am a
core team member of the project and was the PTL (Project Team Lead) from 2017
to 2019.

In my spare time, I love flying gliders with the `Soaring Club of Houston 
<http://scoh.org/>`_. I am a PADI certified Advanced Open Water, Wreck and
Nitrox scuba diver. I also do my best to teach myself to play the piano on a
daily basis.

Why am I writing this blog?
---------------------------

At the time of writing this, I was going through a series of video lectures
titled `Computational Linear Algebra for Coders
<https://github.com/fastai/numerical-linear-algebra>`_. The lecturer, Rachel
Thomas, suggests a series of `reasons why one should write a technical blog
<https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045>`_.
Among those reasons, the one that caught my attention is *"Helps you learn.
Organizing knowledge always helps me synthesize my own ideas. One of the tests
of whether you understand something is whether you can explain it to someone
else. A blog post is a great way to do that."*. So, there it is: I write this
blog because I want to learn. If along the way I can share some ideas or
knowledge with my readers, even better!

As the blog's name suggests, the focus will be computer code, mostly Python.
Occasionally, though, I will write about the many other topics that interest
me (too many for my own good!).
